# DevOps Bash Scripting

Welcome to **DevOps-Bash-Scripting**, a repository where I document my Bash scripting journey through practical challenges and exercises.  
It includes the **Bash Battle Arena ðŸŽ®** â€“ a level-based game for learning Bash â€“ and **4 fundamental Bash scripting tasks** designed to strengthen core skills.

---

## **Thoughts & Reflections**
Working through these Bash challenges has been both **eye-opening and rewarding**.  
Bash scripting might look simple at first glance, but the real skill lies in writing **clean, efficient, and reliable scripts** that solve problems with minimal effort.  

The **Bash Battle Arena** challenges pushed me to think like a problem solver â€” combining logic, automation, and system-level commands. Itâ€™s been a great reminder that mastering **the command line is a core skill for DevOps engineers**, and these exercises helped me strengthen both speed and accuracy when working with Linux systems.

This repository reflects:
- Growth in **Bash fundamentals** (loops, conditionals, argument parsing).  
- A deeper understanding of **automation and file manipulation**.  
- The ability to **document and share technical work professionally on GitHub**.

## **Your GitHub Repo**
All my work is uploaded to **[HamsaHAhmed7/DevOps-Bash-Scripting](https://github.com/HamsaHAhmed7/DevOps-Bash-Scripting)**.  
This repository is **dedicated to my learning**, acting as both:
- A **progress tracker** for my DevOps and Bash scripting journey.  
- A **portfolio of skills** to showcase to potential employers.

## **The Game: Bash Battle Arena ðŸŽ®**
The **Bash Battle Arena** is a command-line challenge designed to teach and improve **Bash scripting skills** in a structured, progressive way.  
Players progress through **levels of increasing difficulty**, solving real-world Bash problems.

> **Note:**  
Currently, there is **no interactive VM or website** â€“ all challenges are completed locally, and solutions are pushed to this GitHub repository.

## **Game Structure**
- **Levels:** Start from Level 1 and progress upwards.  
- **Boss Battles:** Every 5th level combines all previous concepts for a big challenge.  
- **Concepts Covered:**  
  - Files & directories  
  - Variables & loops  
  - Conditionals  
  - File manipulation  
  - Argument parsing  
  - Monitoring & automation  
  - Backups & rotations  
  - Menus and interactive scripting

## **Level Progression**
| Level | Topic | Mission |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **1** | The Basics | Create a directory `Arena` with 3 files (`warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, `archer.txt`) and list contents. |
| **2** | Variables & Loops | Print numbers 1 to 10, one per line. |
| **3** | Conditional Statements | Check if `hero.txt` exists in `Arena` and print `Hero found!` or `Hero missing!`. |
| **4** | File Manipulation | Copy all `.txt` files from `Arena` to `Backup`. |
| **5** | **Boss Battle** | Combine Levels 1â€“4: Create `Battlefield`, move `knight.txt` if it exists, and list directories. |
| **6** | Argument Parsing | Print the line count of a given filename (or display `No file provided`). |
| **7** | File Sorting | Sort `.txt` files by size (smallest to largest) and display them. |
| **8** | Multi-File Search | Search for a word/phrase across all `.log` files and list matches. |
| **9** | Monitoring | Monitor a directory for changes and log them with timestamps. |
| **10** | **Boss Battle 2** | Create 5 files with random content, sort by size, and archive files with `Victory`. |
| **11** | Disk Space Report | Check disk space usage for a directory and alert if above a threshold. |
| **12** | Config Parser | Parse `KEY=VALUE` from a config file and display pairs. |
| **13** | Backup with Rotation | Backup a directory and keep the last 5 backups. |
| **14** | Menu Script | Create a menu for system tasks (disk space, uptime, user list). |
| **15** | **Boss Battle 3** | Menu-based advanced script combining backups, config parsing, and monitoring. |

## **Complete These 4 BASH Scripting Tasks**
Alongside the levels, this repository includes **4 essential Bash scripting tasks** to reinforce core skills:

1. **Basic Arithmetic**  
   A script that takes **two numbers as input** and performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**, displaying the results.

2. **File Operations**  
   A script that:
   - Creates a directory.  
   - Navigates into it.  
   - Creates a file, writes text inside it, and displays the file contents.

3. **Conditional Statements**  
   A script that:
   - Checks if a file exists.  
   - Prints a message indicating existence.  
   - If it exists, checks if itâ€™s **readable, writable, or executable**.

4. **Backup Script**  
   A script that:
   - Copies all `.txt` files from a specified directory to a **backup directory**.  
   - Creates the backup directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
