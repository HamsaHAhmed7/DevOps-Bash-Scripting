# DevOps Bash Scripting

This repository is where Iâ€™ve been sharpening my Bash scripting skills through **real, hands-on challenges**.  
Inside, youâ€™ll find the **Bash Battle Arena ðŸŽ®** â€“ a set of 15 progressive levels designed to build and test practical Bash knowledge â€“ along with **4 standalone Bash scripting tasks** covering core automation concepts.

---

## **Thoughts & Reflections**
Working through these challenges has been both **practical and fun**.  
Bash might look straightforward, but thereâ€™s a lot of depth when it comes to writing scripts that are not just functional, but **clean, efficient, and easy to maintain**.

The **Bash Battle Arena** pushed me to think differently â€” not just about solving a problem, but about solving it in the **best possible way**. These exercises made me faster and more confident when working with the Linux command line, which is a **must-have skill for DevOps engineers**.

This repository represents:
- Solid experience with **Bash fundamentals** â€“ from loops and conditionals to argument parsing.  
- A deeper understanding of **automation, file operations, and monitoring**.  
- The habit of **documenting and sharing technical work professionally** on GitHub.

## **GitHub Repository**
All the work is available here: **[HamsaHAhmed7/DevOps-Bash-Scripting](https://github.com/HamsaHAhmed7/DevOps-Bash-Scripting)**.  
This repository serves as both:
- A **record of my progress** as I build DevOps skills.  
- A **portfolio** to showcase scripting and automation knowledge to recruiters or potential employers.

## **The Game: Bash Battle Arena ðŸŽ®**
The **Bash Battle Arena** is a structured challenge series where each level focuses on a different Bash concept.  
Every 5th level is a **Boss Battle** that brings multiple skills together to test how well everything connects in real-world scenarios.

> **Note:**  
These challenges are completed locally (no web app yet). Each solution is pushed here to GitHub.

## **Game Structure**
- **Levels:** 15 levels, starting from basics and building up to advanced scripting.  
- **Boss Battles:** Every 5th level combines everything learned so far.  
- **Core Skills Covered:**  
  - Working with files and directories  
  - Loops, variables, and conditionals  
  - File manipulation and argument parsing  
  - Monitoring, automation, and backups  
  - Interactive menu scripting

## **Level Progression**
| Level | Topic | Mission |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **1** | The Basics | Create a directory `Arena` with 3 files (`warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, `archer.txt`) and list contents. |
| **2** | Variables & Loops | Print numbers 1 to 10, one per line. |
| **3** | Conditional Statements | Check if `hero.txt` exists in `Arena` and print `Hero found!` or `Hero missing!`. |
| **4** | File Manipulation | Copy all `.txt` files from `Arena` to `Backup`. |
| **5** | **Boss Battle** | Combine Levels 1â€“4: Create `Battlefield`, move `knight.txt` if it exists, and list directories. |
| **6** | Argument Parsing | Print the line count of a given filename (or display `No file provided`). |
| **7** | File Sorting | Sort `.txt` files by size (smallest to largest) and display them. |
| **8** | Multi-File Search | Search for a word/phrase across all `.log` files and list matches. |
| **9** | Monitoring | Monitor a directory for changes and log them with timestamps. |
| **10** | **Boss Battle 2** | Create 5 files with random content, sort by size, and archive files with `Victory`. |
| **11** | Disk Space Report | Check disk space usage for a directory and alert if above a threshold. |
| **12** | Config Parser | Parse `KEY=VALUE` from a config file and display pairs. |
| **13** | Backup with Rotation | Backup a directory and keep the last 5 backups. |
| **14** | Menu Script | Create a menu for system tasks (disk space, uptime, user list). |
| **15** | **Boss Battle 3** | Menu-based advanced script combining backups, config parsing, and monitoring. |

## **The 4 Core Bash Tasks**
Beyond the game, I also worked on 4 key tasks to build a strong foundation:

1. **Basic Arithmetic**  
   Takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **File Operations**  
   Creates a directory, navigates into it, creates a file, writes text to it, and displays the content.

3. **Conditional Statements**  
   Checks if a file exists and shows if itâ€™s readable, writable, or executable.

4. **Backup Script**  
   Copies all `.txt` files to a backup folder (creates one if it doesnâ€™t exist).
